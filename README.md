# Conda Channel for Project Clice

#### Usage
You can use packages in this channel by
```
pixi project channel add https://clice-io.github.io/conda-channel/
```

#### Add or modify a recipe
We use [rattler-build](https://rattler-build.prefix.dev/) to build a conda package. Create a new dir and write your recipe. Github CI will automatically build it.
